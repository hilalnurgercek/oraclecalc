OracleCalc

OracleCalc is a fun, GUI-based fake calculator built with Pygame. It looks like a regular calculator, but secretly produces "oracle-like" responses to calculations when prompted with a special voice command. It sneaks in surprises where you'd expect plain math.


Technologies & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Pygame – for creating the graphical user interface.
- SpeechRecognition – to process voice input and trigger special responses.
- PyAudio – for capturing audio input from the microphone.
- re (Regex) – for parsing and matching recognized text.
- Threading – to handle voice input alongside GUI updates without freezing the interface.# oraclecalc
